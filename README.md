## Scripts and One-Liners

This is just a collection of scripts and code that I have had to use more than once over the last few years. Some of it might be helpful for various reasons, and some of it might be useless. I will do my best to give credit to all og sources if that is the case, and if I have forgotten, I apologize ahead of time.

[https://burmat.gitbook.io/security/] has writings that go hand-in-hand with this repo.

Please don't do anything stupid with things you might find here. Use it at your own risk, as I will not take responsibility.
