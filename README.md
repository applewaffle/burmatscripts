## Scripts and One-Liners

This a place to drop scripts and code I have collected in the last few years. Some of it might be helpful for various reasons, and some of it might be useless. If I have not given credit where it is due, please PM me and accept my apologies in advance.

[https://burmat.gitbook.io/security/] has writings that go hand-in-hand with this repo.

Please don't do anything stupid with things you might find here. Use it at your own risk, as I will not take responsibility.
